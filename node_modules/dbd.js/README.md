### Using Variables

What are variables? They can be used for many things, especially allowing to save data.

Such as allowing level system, currency system and much more!

```js
bot.variables({
  Name: "Value",
  Name2: "Value2"
})
```

### Callbacks

What are callbacks?

It's simple and easy process, it essentially allows you to run events, such as user joining a Guild.
This will trigger a event, causing a code to be executed such as.

```js
bot.joinCommand({
        channel: "Channel ID", 
        code: `<@$authorID> just joined, welcome!`
})
bot.onJoined()
```

### Setting Bot Status

Add a custom message to your Bot Activity!

```js
bot.status({
  text: "TEXT",
  type: "PLAYING",
  time: 12
})
```
